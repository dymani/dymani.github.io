In this blog post, I will talk about some progress I made before I set up this devblog.<!--break--> ;)

<br>
<h3><b>First game - Snake</b></h3>

Remaking Snake is the goal for my first few games in wirtten in C++. I first wrote two ASCII-based Snake clones. The first one is terrible since the scaling is all wrong.The second one is better in my opinion.

I made the third one using SFML and the graphics is much better. Still a simple game though. The fourth one is just the same game but with different textures.

<h3>Mazy</h3>

After making a few clones of Snake, I made this maze game called Mazy (stupid name :P). In this game, the player just needs to avoid hitting the enemies to get coins.

It is my first trial to make a game that loads contents dynamically and I learnt a lot through making this.

<b>
<h3>Aviate</h3>

This is a side project I made during making another game called Brain Burst 2039, which I will talk about later in this post. The player can fly around in the game to collect points and power-ups. It's still not very fun for me, but it's (kind of) a complete game with some pixel arts and sounds.

<h3>Brain Burst 2039</h3>

![](/assets/image/blog/blog_13-05-16_bb2039.png)

It is a game that I started planning long time ago but it is still under development now. It was once a 2D top-down adventure game, but I found a 2D side scroller is easier to make and more fun to me.

This is a game based on Accel World, an anime / light novel series by Kawahara Reki. I love this series so much that I decided to make a game about it. <3 <3

That's all the stuff I made before making this devblog. I will write a post here once I have new progress to show you. See you! :)
