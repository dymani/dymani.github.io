<h3>Previous progress</h3>

In this blog post, I will talk about some progress I made before I set up this devblog. ;)

<h4>First game - Snake</h4>

Remaking Snake is the goal for my first few games in wirtten in C++.<!--break-->

I first wrote two ASCII-based Snake clones. The first one is terrible since the scaling is all wrong.The second one is better in my opinion.

I made the third one using SFML and the graphics is much better. Still a simple game though.

<h4>Mazy</h4>

After making a few clones of Snake, I make this maze game called Mazy (stupid name :P).

In this game, the player just needs to avoid hitting the enemies to get coins.

It is my first trial to make a game that loads contents dynamically and I learnt a lot through making this.

<h4>Aviate</h4>

This is a side project I made during making another game called Brain Burst 2039, which I will talk about later in this post.

The player can fly around in the game to collect points and power-ups.

It's still not very fun for me, but it's (kind of) a complete game with some pixel arts and sounds.

You can try it here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dymani/Aviate)

<h4>Brain Burst 2039</h4>

It is a game that I started planning long time ago but it is still under development now.

It was once a 2D top-down adventure game, but I found a 2D side scroller is easier to make and more fun to me.

This is a game based on Accel World, an anime / light novel series by Kawahara Reki.

I love this series so much that I decided to make a game about it. <3 <3

<h4>To conclude...</h4>

That's all the stuff I made before this devblog. I will make a post here once I have new progress to show you.

See you! :)
