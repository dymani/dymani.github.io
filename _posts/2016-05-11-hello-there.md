<center>This is the template I used. Dark Kimochi Theme by Spaghetti.</center>

This is my first blog and I want to post more about my gamedev life on here. I set up this devblog yesterday night, just before my Chinese test. Lol. I still have to tweak the colours and styles of the page though.<!--break-->

By the way, I am having my final exams really soon, so I won't be working on my projects as well as updating this blog as often. I will have more time at the end of June.

Anyway, hope you'll enjoy my blog! Remeber to check out my games! ;)
