<!--arrow-->I am finally back from the exams! I will briefly cover my plan in this summer holiday in this blog post.<!--index-->

<h3><b>Gamedev - Bran Burst 2039</b></h3>

I am going to start this project again, from the ground up. I have been planning the remake and working on the game design document since May. And hopefully I can show you some progress very soon.

<h3><b>Steam games</b></h3>

In the recent Steam summer sale, I've bought a few games to play. They are:

 * Undertale
 * Spelunky
 * The Beginner's Guide
 * Don't Starve
 * FEZ

I bought them since they are recommended by some gamedevs including the Extra Credits guys.

I think I should have enough time to enjoy these games and probably I will learn something about game design. The only problem I have right now is that my notebook cannot handle the 3D graphics well. It crashes occasionally because of overheating.

<h3><b>Me and my devblog</b></h3>

Actually I still have some others things to do in this summer holiday, but I might reveal them one day in the near future. Or maybe later.

At last, I want to say that I am now considering rebuilding this devblog. I think I could have built it better using WordPress or tumblr. Also, I might register a proper domain for my blog and email. We'll see. ;)
