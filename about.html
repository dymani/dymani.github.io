Hi, my name is dymani. I am a 16-yo student and a gamedev hobbyist from Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>
I enjoy developing games and my current goal is to become a game developer after graduation. But I still don't know whether I want to be an indie or work overseas.
<br>
<br>
As a gamedev hobbyist, I am now working on some projects related to my favourite anime/light novel series, Accel World. Please check that out, it's awesome! ;)
<br>
<br>
Hope you'll enjoy this devblog. :)
